memory - Memory model

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This document describes the memory model of the kernel.

The X15 kernel uses the freestanding execution environment. As a result,
atomics as provided by <stdatomic.h> are not available. Instead, the kernel
provides its own library of atomic operations, based on the GCC "built-in
functions for memory model aware atomic operations". In addition, it also
provides "local atomic" operations, interrupt-safe operations that are
atomic on the local processor. These operations can transparently replace
atomic operations on single-processor configurations.

INTRA-THREAD MEMORY ORDERING
----------------------------

Memory ordering in a single thread of execution behaves as defined by
the C specification the kernel is conforming to. This means that the
generated code must not change the _observable behavior_ of the program,
which is informally called the _as-if rule_. During its execution,
the kernel may change the environment, and environmental changes may
conflict with compiler optimizations. For example, it may configure
an MMU and change the entire memory map. Compiler optimizations, and
in particular instruction reordering, may cause instructions intended
to run with the new memory map to run with the previous one, and
potentially trigger a fault. Since the compiler cannot recognize such
situations and adjust the generated code accordingly, this is a
responsibility of the developer.

This memory model defines several ways to control code generation.

Local atomic operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Local atomic operations_, as defined in module:kern/latomic, are similar
to global atomic operations, but are only valid on a single processor.
They are atomic with respect to one another and interrupts. Because they
may not be used for inter-processor communication, they allow a cheaper
implementation than atomic operations. Because they only need to be
atomic with respect to one another and interrupts, they may be provided by
a generic and portable implementation built with interrupt-based critical
sections, which is useful when starting a new port, or if the target
architecture supports a single processor at most and doesn't provide
atomic instructions.

Strong sequencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Strong sequence points_ are defined as sequence points that affect the
implementation in addition to the abstract machine. The _strongly
sequenced before_ and _strongly sequenced after_ relations are similar
to _sequenced before_ and _sequenced after_ respectively, except that
they affect the implementation in addition to the abstract machine.

Here is the list of strong sequence points :

* SC local atomic operation or fence
* SC global atomic operation or fence
* volatile inline assembly with the memory clobber
