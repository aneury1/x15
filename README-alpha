X15 is unstable. You should expect it to not work. You should expect it to have
security problems. The API will likely change. This is the development release.
A proper release will be made in due time.

Some of the files that are included in the X15 tarball, such as files generated
by autotools, are not stored in the repository. Therefore, to build X15 you
need to run "autoreconf" before of anything else:

  $ autoreconf -i
  $ ./configure
  ...

This will generate all directories and files needed by the build system. For
instructions about the build system, check the INSTALL file.
